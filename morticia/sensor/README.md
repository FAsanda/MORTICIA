## The Sensor Package
The sensor package of MORTICIA provides modelling of sensors, which can comprise a mixture of optics and electronics
as well as a display and human observer. Direct view systems comprise optics human observer only (telescope or
binoculars). Any system that includes electronic components is an electro-optical system. Electronic components
can include detectors, image processing modules and displays.

If the sensor includes a human observer, the sensor becomes capable of estimating ranges/probabilities of
detection, recognition and identification (DRI).
