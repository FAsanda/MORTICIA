Transmittance and Path Radiance in libRadtran

\begin_layout Standard
REMs are required over the full range of SZA for all key conditions.
 It is possible to compute the path transmittance between target and sensor
 for the VZA equal to SZA (or the complement of SZA, since transmittance
 is the same in either direction) by taking the ratio of the direct solar
 irradiance at the lower height to the direct solar irradiance at the upper
 height.
 Transmittance for paths at angles between the SZA set will have to be interpola
ted.
 Horizontal paths are meaningless in this context, since the pathlength
 is infinite.
 Curve-fitting to the transmittance vector versus VZA should be considered
 as the relationship will be non-linear.
 It is also very dependent on wavelength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the transmittance has been computed for all sightlines in the REM pair,
 the path radiance can be computed with reference to Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Consider two points (generally target and sensor) in the atmosphere at
 heights 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 The two points lie on a linear slant path of a particular zenith angle.

\begin_layout Standard
The radiance at point 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 along the slant path in the downward direction is 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{a}^{\downarrow}$
\end_inset

 and the upward radiance along the slant path at point 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 (towards point 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

) is denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{a}^{\uparrow}$
\end_inset

 and likewise for point 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 The path radiance in the upward direction from 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{ab}^{\uparrow}$
\end_inset

 (the arrow is actually redundant since the order of the subscripts can
 denote the direction) and the downward path radiance is 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{ba}^{\downarrow}$
\end_inset

.The path transmittance is denoted using 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 with relevant subscripts.
 The path transmittance is independent of the direction (but the path radiance
 does depend on the direction).
 libRadtran can be used to compute the upward and downward radiances along
 the slant path at each of the two altitudes.
 The following equations are then easily solved for the path radiances from
 the environment radiances and transmittances,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
L_{b}^{\uparrow} & = & \tau_{ab}L_{a}^{\uparrow}+L_{ab}^{\uparrow}\\
L_{a}^{\downarrow} & = & \tau_{ab}L_{b}^{\downarrow}+L_{ba}^{\downarrow}.
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path radiances are simply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
L_{ab}^{\uparrow} & =L_{b}^{\uparrow}-\tau_{ab}L_{a}^{\uparrow}\\
L_{ba}^{\downarrow} & =L_{a}^{\downarrow}-\tau_{ab}L_{b}^{\downarrow}.
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upward radiances are the radiance values in the lower hemispheres of the
 REMs and downward radiances are radiance values in the upper hemispheres
 of the REMs.
 The path radiances will generally comprise a half hemisphere, above horizon
 and one side of the solar principal plane for downwelling path radiances
 and sightlines looking above horizon and another half hemisphere, below
 horizon and one side of the solar principal plane for sightlines looking
 below the horizon.
 These path radiances can be incorporated into a single dataset having the
 same size as the REM.
 However, it is important to remember that when looking upward, the target
 is at 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{b}$
\end_inset

 and is therefore rendered using the REM at 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{b}$
\end_inset

 and when looking downward, the target is at 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{a}$
\end_inset

 and must therefore be rendered using the REM at 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The at-target radiance is computed using a raytracing engine.
 The camera image of the target can then be rendered using the BOSM and
 inserted into the sensor view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way forward in reaching this implementation was first to establish the
 runtime of a full radiant environment map with libRadtran using the Kato
 correlated-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 parametrisation.
 The SZA resolution for a specific atmosphere/surface combination is an
 important consideration as path transmittance must be interpolated between
 computed SZA values.
 On the Icebow compute cluster (24 processors), a full REM at 128 sightlines
 per 180
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, with 8 Kato spectral bands, 2 heights and 12 SZAs completes in under 1
 minute.
 Compiling the results from the uvspec output files takes a further 20 seconds.
 This means that the scheme is certainly viable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, at this stage the raytracing engine cannot be used on the cluster to
 generate correct azimuth/elevation views of the target, the above approach
 can still be used to compute target illuminance, by integrating the radiant
 environment map over the appropriate hemisphere in the conventional way.
 This is an alternative to using SMARTS (and more consistent, since the
 atmospheric models are now uniform across target irradiance, path radiance
 and transmittance computations).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If targets are completely lambertian and self-shadowing of the target can
 be neglected, there are methods of reducing the REM to an Irradiance Environmen
t Map (IEM) and decomposing the IEM into a small number of spherical harmonic
 coefficients.
 This allows very rapid rendering of convex, lambertian targets.
 Computation of spherical harmonic coefficients may have to be mediated
 through resampling to another directional scheme, such as

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, all of the radiative transfer could, in principle, be done using libRadtra
n, which is a lot easier to set up than MODTRAN and also faster, especially
 if the Kato correlated-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 approach is adopted.
 The only limitation with Kato is that the spectral sensitivity of the sensor
 can only be expressed as a linear combination of the bands in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Kato-Correlated-k-Bands"

\end_inset

.
 The libRadtran driver utility (

 bands using the

 Only 8 of the 32 Kato bands fall into the spectral region of interest in
 this problem.
 These are bands 13 to 20, giving a spectral coverage of 605
