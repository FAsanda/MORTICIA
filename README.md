# MORTICIA
MORTICIA is Monte-carlo Optical Rendering for Theatre Investigations of Capability under the Influence of the Atmosphere, 
an open-source optical surveillance modelling framework written mainly in Python.

The key elements of MORTICIA are:

 + Physically accurate rendering of targets of interest in atmospheric conditions that are statistically representative 
 of the theatre of operations.
 + Statistically valid Monte-carlo simulations of the Detect, Recognition and Identification (DRI) ranges of such targets
 in the theatre of operations.
